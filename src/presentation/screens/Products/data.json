        "description": "A Business Line of Credit gives you the flexibility to access needed funds quickly and conveniently. It's a financing option that's tailored to your business's needs, while allowing you to cover any expense that might arise. One of the key benefits is that you only pay for what you use. This means you only get charged based on the amount you draw from your line of credit, rather than the entire amount that you're approved for. There are many unsecured business line of credit options available, meaning that you don't need to put collateral down to get funding.",
